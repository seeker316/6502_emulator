so currently i have made all the architecture...from the documentation and okay i don't think there is any need to mention it as you can see from my code...i think it'll be fair enough to say thast this is m first cpp project so apologies,.....
okay then back to it from what i understand i have a rpugh idea of how the rough workflow will go on it'll be

my memory will contain opcode of instructions i'll fetch instruction opcodes from memory with help of program counter then with the opcode as my index for the defined instructionset table i'll some how find a way to execute the instruction that the opcode instructs to....currently i don't have a proper plan of doing it ...let's see if i can get my brain around it ....;)


it is jan 20 8:13 am and i am done with all the declarations and i've defined the instruction table which contains the op codes now iam going to start with the function definitions..............


so it is jan 20 and 17:24 after seeing the above entry ....bruh i've wasted my full day is how i feel....that's way to slow....the progress is i've developed helper functions to load code in the memory, to fetch the instructions and execute them....now I think i am finally ready to start with function declarations :()
